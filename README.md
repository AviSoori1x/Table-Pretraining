The official repository which contains the code and pre-trained models for our paper [T<span style="font-size:0.8em;">A</span>PE<span style="font-size:0.8em;">X</span>: Table Pre-training via Learning a Neural SQL Executor](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07653.pdf).

# üî• Updates

- 2021-08-27: We released the code, the pre-training corpus, and the pre-trained TAPEX model weights. Thanks for your patience!
- 2021-07-16: We released our paper. Check it out!

# üè¥Û†Å∂Û†ÅµÛ†Å≠Û†Å°Û†Å∞Û†Åø Overview



# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

Although our model employ fairseq as the backend framework, we already wrap all necessary commands for developers.
In other words, you do not need to study it to start your journey about TAPEX!
